## Backend Services Setup

This project uses Docker Compose to manage all backend services including the database, database admin panel, and mail server.

## Services

1. **PostgreSQL Database**
   - Version: Latest
   - Port: 5433 (host) -> 5432 (container)
   - Database: postgres
   - User: postgres
   - Password: postgres

2. **Database Admin Panel (Adminer)**
   - Port: 8080
   - Access: http://localhost:8080
   - Server: db (internal Docker service name)
   - Username: postgres
   - Password: postgres
   - Database: postgres

3. **Mail Server (MailHog)**
   - SMTP Port: 1025 (host) -> 1025 (container)
   - Web UI Port: 8025 (host) -> 8025 (container)
   - Access: http://localhost:8025

## Environment Configuration

The application supports different environments:

### Development Mode
- Uses Docker containers for all services
- Configuration loaded from `.env.development`
- Mail service uses MailHog for email interception
- Database runs in a Docker container
- Frontend URL defaults to `http://localhost:5173`

### Production Mode
- Configuration loaded from `.env.production`
- Uses real SMTP server for email sending
- Connects to production database
- Frontend URL must be configured

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured:

#### Database
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string

#### Mail
- `MAIL_HOST`: SMTP server hostname
- `MAIL_PORT`: SMTP server port
- `MAIL_SECURE`: Whether to use SSL/TLS
- `MAIL_USER`: SMTP username
- `MAIL_PASS`: SMTP password
- `MAIL_FROM`: Default sender email address
- `MAIL_FORWARD_TO`: Optional email address to forward all emails to

#### JWT
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token signing
- `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`: Secret key for refresh token signing
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`: Access token expiration time

#### Application
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)
- `FRONTEND_URL`: URL of the frontend application (used for password reset links)

To switch between environments, set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable:
```bash
# Development (default)
export NODE_ENV=development

# Production
export NODE_ENV=production
```

## Usage

### Starting Services

```bash
# Windows
.\start-all.bat

# Or directly with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

The start script will automatically check the availability of all services before completing.

### Stopping Services

```bash
# Windows
.\stop-all.bat

# Or directly with Docker Compose
docker-compose down
```

## Health Checks

The services include health checks to ensure they're running properly:
- Database: Uses `pg_isready` to check PostgreSQL readiness
- Database Admin Panel: Checks HTTP response
- Mail Server: Checks if the web UI is accessible

## Volumes

- `postgres_data`: Persists PostgreSQL data
- `mailhog_data`: Persists MailHog email data

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter version compatibility issues with the database, you may need to remove the volumes:
```
docker-compose down -v
```

Then start the services again:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

If you encounter migration issues with Prisma, you can use the direct database push approach:
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

This bypasses the migration system and directly applies the schema to the database.

## Service Access

After starting the services, you can access:

1. **Database Admin Panel**: http://localhost:8080
   - System: PostgreSQL
   - Server: db
   - Username: postgres
   - Password: postgres
   - Database: postgres

2. **Mail Server Web UI**: http://localhost:8025
   - View captured emails sent by the application
   - Test email functionality during development

## Database Setup

The project uses Prisma as the ORM for database operations. The database schema is defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.

### Initializing the Database

To set up the database for the first time, run:
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

This command directly applies the schema to the database without using migrations, which can help avoid issues with PostgreSQL collation version mismatches.

### Working with Migrations

For production environments, it's recommended to use migrations:
```bash
# Create a new migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name

# Apply migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

If you encounter migration errors due to existing objects in the database, you may need to reset the database:
```bash
# Reset the database (removes all data)
npx prisma migrate reset --force
```

Note: If you encounter collation version mismatch errors with PostgreSQL, use `npx prisma db push` instead of the migration commands.

## Email Configuration

### Development
In development mode, the application uses MailHog to intercept and display emails:
- SMTP Server: localhost:1025
- Web Interface: http://localhost:8025

### Production
In production mode, the application connects directly to your SMTP server using credentials from environment variables:
- MAIL_HOST: SMTP server hostname
- MAIL_PORT: SMTP server port
- MAIL_SECURE: Whether to use TLS (true/false)
- MAIL_USER: SMTP username
- MAIL_PASS: SMTP password
- MAIL_FROM: Default sender address

The start-all.bat script will verify that all services are accessible before completing, ensuring that your development environment is ready.
